Using SQL


Business problem:

As a platform of Online Movie Order System, the purpose of the database is to maintain, manage and update the data used to support customers’ online movie orders. 

Customers can order movies online and get access to the movie in a limited time. 
Staff can maintain the data of transactions within the platform, track the online movie orders status in customers’ accounts, manage the data of customers and movies to support customers’ orders. 

Through the database, the platform can not only show every detail of current available movies and update the new release movies promptly, but also provide better search experience for potential customers. 
The database will be used by administrative staff only.
